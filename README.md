# Mod20_Segment_4
The team task is to practice. Each of us will participate in the presentation over Zoom. Record it. Are there slow spots, or maybe a section that could use further clarity? This is also the segment where all loose ends that have been lingering are tied up (e.g., anything related to the machine learning model, dashboard, or even the analysis). Individual roles will have time dedicated to wrapping up tasks. The final README.md in the project repository will need to be tidied up and made portfolio-ready. All of the outstanding PRs are either completed and merged, or discarded and deleted. A final editorial sweep is necessary to make sure the code is clean and readable. The dashboard and presentation should be complete and ready for sharing, and a final check on overall quality is completed.
