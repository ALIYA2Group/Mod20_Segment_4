# Presentation (8 Minutes)
Welcome to ALYAGroup 2 project overview on Climate Change and the Impact of Artic Sea Ice melting in the Northpole. This is as opposed to south pole where glaciers are melting as well, just not as fast as the Artic. Even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, meaning your children, grandchildren, chiderns, generations of work, more than a third of the world’s remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100 and its 2022. So that is 78 years from now. However, Scientists project that if emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice free in the summer as soon as the year 2040 as ocean and air temperatures continue to rise rapidly.

When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone. Today, the Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere on earth, and the sea ice there is declining by more than 10% every 10 years. As this ice melts, darker patches of ocean start to emerge, eliminating the effect that previously cooled the poles, creating warmer air temperatures and in turn disrupting normal patterns of ocean circulation.

## Q&A:

# 1. Can you summarize the Project?  

We created the foundation for the final project. By defining roles between team members and establishing a communication structure. We wanted to see if we could predict the melting of Artic Sea Ice. We create a repository for the project and invite the other team members. We made great strides in building the different pieces of the project. The analysis come along nicely, and we worked on the machine learning model, and the databases were transitioned into an operational, data-holding tool. All of the individual pieces we've been building come together. We assembled these pieces, putting the final touches on the repository. Working on the README.md to fully describe the project and its purpose. The repository would be ready to be added to your portfolio. The team’s final task is to practice the presentation. Each of us will participate in the presentation over Zoom. Record it. There were slow spots, and sections to clarity. All loose ends that have been lingering were tied up especially anything related to the machine learning model, dashboard, or even the analysis. It was a short few weeks to perform ELT, MLT and Dashboard, and we were successful.  Based on past features of science exploration and calculation on melting and atmosphere changes we extracted, transformed and loaded the selected trends to  show the sea-ice diminishing from 2003-2020 to try and predict future  size of the arctic sea ice extent.

# 2. Challenges 

MTL future forecasting and fitting the model with new time series SARAMAX model because we discovered and implimented the seasonal time-series model. Limitation Of SARAMAX Model. Website Development and Database connectivity.
